Research questions:
1. how does genre influence the average rating of a film?
→ Are there genres that consistently receive higher or lower ratings?
2. how does the ‘tag’ influence the average rating of a film?
→ Are there tags that consistently receive higher or lower ratings?
3. how does the year of release affect the average rating of a film?
→ Are there release years that consistently receive higher or lower ratings?

Similarity is determined by:
- Matching tags
- Matching genres
- A release year that is as close as possible to the given year

To-Do-List:
- Feature erstellen, das die userIDs aller Rater für die jeweiligen Movies verknüpft.
